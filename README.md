# redirectv3

`https://redirectv3-i978.vercel.app/{URI}`

Just put URI behind it.
No need to encode URIs
~~Don't forget to [encode the URI](https://www.urlencoder.io/)!~~


v1 is here,  https://github.com/QsZyN/redirect 
# For what?
For URIs with pathetic schemes that are not recognized as links. For example, with [consense](https://scrapbox.io/).
